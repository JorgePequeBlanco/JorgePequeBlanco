I program in **Python**, **C++**, **C** and **ARM** and **x86 Assembly** and also, I know a few of **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. I like electronics, physics and maths. In my free time I develop **embedded systems**, **videogames**, **graphics**, **audio** and **physics** engines and very small **kernels**.
